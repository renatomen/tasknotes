# TaskNotes 4.0.4

## Added

- (#1134, #779) Added CMD+Enter (Mac) / Ctrl+Enter (Windows/Linux) keyboard shortcut support for saving in all modals
  - Works from any input field in task creation, task edit, time entry, timeblock, and property selector modals
  - Thanks to @luckb0x, @hamlim and @nightroman for the feature requests

## Fixed

- (#1181) Fixed vertical overflow in Kanban view columns with fewer than 15 tasks
  - Prevents cards from extending beyond column boundaries before virtualization activates
  - Thanks to @lomarcanys for reporting
- (#1177) Bases views now anchor recurring completion and calendar navigation to the right date
  - Recurring completion from Bases Task List/Kanban uses the task's scheduled/due date instead of "today" (fixes complete_instances)
  - Bases calendar navigation and property-based events use UTC anchors to avoid previous-day jumps
  - Thanks to @nslee123 for flagging the issue
- Bases calendar navigation now respects UTC-anchored dates to avoid landing on the previous day
  - Corrected all-day end date calculation to prevent off-by-one spans
  - Added regression test for the UTC anchor behavior
  - Thanks to KaCii for [flagging the issue](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/1433165116702199880/1439757826380660767)

## Changed

- Refactored plugin styling to better align with Obsidian's native UI conventions
  - Replaced all `cursor: pointer` with `cursor: var(--cursor)` (100+ instances) to follow Obsidian's cursor convention
  - Removed forced `border: none; box-shadow: none` rules that were fighting against Obsidian's native button styling
  - Scoped custom `.tn-btn` button system to settings modal only (`.mod-settings`), allowing Obsidian's native button styles to work elsewhere
  - Thanks to @kepano for guidance
