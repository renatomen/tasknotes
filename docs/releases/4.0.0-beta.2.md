## Changed

- **NLP system overhaul**
  - Replaced `StatusSuggestionService` wrapper with direct `NaturalLanguageParser` usage
  - Consolidated trigger configuration into unified `TriggerConfigService`
  - Enhanced `NaturalLanguageParser` with full trigger and user field support
  - Removed custom # tag autocomplete in favor of Obsidian's native tag suggester (when using # trigger)
- **Task card and editor improvements**
  - Simplified `TaskCard` interface - removed unused options (showCheckbox, showArchiveButton, groupByDate)
  - Refactored `TaskLinkWidget` to use unified `TaskCard` component for consistency
  - Added support for inline vs. block layout modes in task cards
  - Improved task card BEM CSS with better styling for inline mode
- **Settings UI enhancements**
  - NLP triggers now configurable through Settings > Features tab
  - Added settings for inline task card visible properties
  - Improved appearance tab with property selector integration
  - Better organization of NLP-related settings
- Refactored Bases views to use Component lifecycle properly
  - Views now extend Component and use onload()/onunload()
  - Automatic cleanup of event listeners via Component.registerDomEvent()
  - Improved state management and ephemeral state handling
- Improved development experience
  - Converted ESLint errors to warnings for non-blocking development
  - Fixed various linting issues and unused imports

## Removed

- Removed `StatusSuggestionService` (functionality consolidated into `NaturalLanguageParser`)

## Breaking Changes

- **Relationships widget settings consolidated** (automatic migration)
  - Old settings removed: `showProjectSubtasks`, `projectSubtasksPosition`, `showTaskDependencies`, `taskDependenciesPosition`
  - New unified settings: `showRelationships`, `relationshipsPosition`
  - Widget now appears on ALL notes (tasks, projects, regular notes) - Bases filtering controls which tabs are visible
  - **Migration**: Existing users will see the new unified widget automatically. If you had project subtasks enabled, relationships widget will be enabled by default
  - **Bases file change**: The command mapping changed from `'project-subtasks': 'TaskNotes/Views/project-subtasks.base'` to `'relationships': 'TaskNotes/Views/relationships.base'`
  - Run "Create Default Files" in Settings > General to create the new `relationships.base` file
