# Tasknotes 3.25.6

## Fixed

- (#1013) Fixed inability to subscribe to Apple iCloud calendars
  - Calendar URLs copied from Apple Calendar (starting with webcal://) can now be pasted directly
  - Previously required manually changing the URL format before it would be accepted
  - Works with both standard and secure calendar URLs (webcal:// and webcals://)
  - Thanks to @nickbirch51 for reporting

- (#1022) Fixed tasks randomly disappearing from views and not being recognized
  - Tasks would appear initially but disappear after a few seconds, especially during long sessions
  - Restarting Obsidian or using "Refresh Cache" would only temporarily fix the issue
  - Thanks to @seepage87 for reporting and @alejandrospoz for help debugging

- (#968) Fixed timeEntries being duplicated when mapped to custom property name
  - When timeEntries was configured to use a custom property name in Metadata settings (e.g., time_entries), saving tasks would create duplicate entries in both the custom property and the default timeEntries property
  - FieldMapper now correctly uses only the configured property name for time tracking data
  - Thanks to @minchinweb for reporting this issue 

- (#953) Fixed non-task notes incorrectly appearing as subtasks in views
  - Notes with Parent or project properties but no task tag/property no longer show up as tasks
  - Views now update correctly when task tags are removed from files
  - Improved performance for large vaults by optimizing cache invalidation
  - Thanks to @renatomen for reporting and submitting PR #955
