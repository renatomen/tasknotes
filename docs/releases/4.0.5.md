# TaskNotes 4.0.5

## Changed

- (#790) Task edit modal now shows unresolved project links with appropriate styling
	- Similar to how dependencies are displayed, unresolved projects now appear with visual indication
	- Hovering over an unresolved project shows a tooltip explaining it couldn't be resolved
	- Thanks to @aubreyz for reporting

## Fixed

- (#1011) Fixed chevrons incorrectly showing on tasks with no subtasks
	- Project index was incorrectly adding all linked files instead of only files referenced in the projects field
	- Now properly parses the projects field and only indexes those specific files as projects
	- Also fixed alias handling in project and dependency links - aliases are now correctly stripped before link resolution
	- Thanks to @craziedde for reporting
- (#1200) Fixed kanban drag & drop not updating task properties correctly
	- Dragging tasks to different columns now properly triggers business logic (completedDate, auto-archive, webhooks)
	- Previously, kanban updates bypassed `updateProperty` and directly modified frontmatter
	- Thanks very much to @tvoklov for the PR
- (#1203) Fixed autocomplete dropdown being clipped inside NLP field boundaries
	- Configure CodeMirror tooltips to render in document.body instead of constrained editor container
	- Prevents suggestion dropdown from being hidden when it extends beyond the NLP field height
	- Thanks to @Andrei-Ioda for reporting
- (#1172) Fixed task lists and checkboxes rendering incorrectly in task details editor
	- Remove padding-left override on `.cm-line` to allow CodeMirror decorations (checkboxes, indentation) to render properly
	- Content padding is now handled by `.cm-content` while `.cm-line` uses natural spacing
	- Thanks to @nightroman for reporting
- Fixed relationships widget not appearing on project notes without frontmatter
	- Widget now correctly shows on any note referenced as a project by tasks, regardless of whether the note has frontmatter
- Fixed task card and relationships widgets not appearing when opening notes in source mode
	- Removed live preview mode restriction to allow widgets to render in both source and live preview modes
- (#901) Fixed calendar view toolbar buttons overflowing on narrow screens
    - Added `flex-wrap: wrap` to calendar header toolbar to allow buttons to wrap to multiple lines
    - Thanks to @RumiaKitinari for reporting
- (#1193), (#1194), (#1185) Fixed new calendar views not respecting user's default calendar settings
	- Previously, new Bases calendar views used hardcoded inline defaults instead of user-configured preferences
	- Calendar view initialization now correctly uses `plugin.settings.calendarViewSettings` as the fallback
	- Thanks @ki5ck, @minchinweb and @ThamirysOlv for reporting 
- Fixed calendar to ensure that it respects user's locale
    - Tries to use calendar locale, then tries UI language, then system language, then falls back to English
- (#1043) Fixed default reminders with "at time of event" (0 offset) not being applied to tasks
	- UI was displaying "1" instead of "0" for zero-offset reminders in settings
	- Thanks to @dblinnikov for reporting
- (#1206) Fixed NLP status parsing regressions with trigger prefixes and temporal keywords
	- Manually typing status trigger + label now correctly parses (e.g., `*Done` when label is `Done`)
	- Status values containing temporal keywords no longer misparsed as dates (e.g., `Expedite = Now`)
	- Thanks very much to @renatomen for the PR
- (#1212) Fixed "Show release notes on update" toggle not saving correctly
    - Thanks to @Jon-dog for reporting
- (#1197) Add Portuguese language to list of translations in general tab settings
    - Allows users to select the Portuguese translation option
    - Thanks to @andysteel for the PR
- Fixed file properties displaying incorrectly in Bases views
	- File properties like `file.name`, `file.basename`, `file.size`, etc. were showing as "Title" or returning null
	- Now correctly extracts and displays all file properties from Obsidian's file metadata
	- Supports both direct TFile properties (name, basename, extension, path, size, ctime, mtime) and computed properties (links, embeds, tags, backlinks, aliases, folder, tasks)
