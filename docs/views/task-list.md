# Task List View

[← Back to Views](../views.md)

The Task List View displays tasks in a scrollable list format with filtering, sorting, and grouping capabilities. In TaskNotes v4, this view operates as a Bases view configured through YAML.

## Bases Architecture

Task List is implemented as a `.base` file located in `TaskNotes/Views/tasks-default.base` by default. It requires the Bases core plugin to be enabled.

### What is Bases?

Bases is an official Obsidian core plugin built directly into Obsidian (not a community plugin). It provides a framework for creating database views of notes and tasks.

To enable Bases:
1. Open Settings → Core Plugins
2. Enable "Bases"
3. TaskNotes view commands will now open `.base` files from `TaskNotes/Views/`

### View File Location

When you use the "Open Tasks View" command or ribbon icon, TaskNotes opens the `.base` file configured under **Settings → TaskNotes → General → View Commands** (initially `TaskNotes/Views/tasks-default.base`). The default file is created automatically the first time you use the command, and you can point the command to any other `.base` file if you maintain multiple task-list layouts.

## Configuration

Task List views are configured through YAML frontmatter in the `.base` file. The YAML defines which tasks to show, how to sort them, and how to group them.

### Basic Structure

```yaml
# All Tasks

views:
  - type: tasknotesTaskList
    name: "All Tasks"
    order:
      - note.status
      - note.priority
      - note.due
      - note.scheduled
      - note.projects
      - note.contexts
      - file.tags
    sort:
      - column: due
        direction: ASC
```

### Configuration Options

**`type`**: Must be `tasknotesTaskList` for Task List views

**`name`**: Display name shown in the view header

**`order`**: Array of property names that control which task properties are visible in the task cards. Properties are referenced using their Bases property paths (e.g., `note.status`, `note.priority`, `note.due`).

**`sort`**: Array of sort criteria. Tasks are sorted by the first criterion, with ties broken by subsequent criteria.
- `column`: Property to sort by (e.g., `due`, `scheduled`, `priority`, `title`)
- `direction`: `ASC` (ascending) or `DESC` (descending)

**`groupBy`**: Optional grouping configuration
- `property`: Property to group by (e.g., `note.status`, `note.priority`)
- `direction`: Sort direction for group headers

**`filters`**: Optional filter conditions using Bases query syntax
```yaml
filters:
  and:
    - note.status == "Open"
    - note.priority == "High"
```

### Property Mapping

TaskNotes properties are accessed in Bases YAML using these paths:

| TaskNotes Property | Bases Property Path | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Status | `note.status` | Task status value |
| Priority | `note.priority` | Priority level |
| Due date | `note.due` | Due date/time |
| Scheduled date | `note.scheduled` | Scheduled date/time |
| Projects | `note.projects` | Associated projects |
| Contexts | `note.contexts` | Task contexts |
| Tags | `file.tags` | File tags |
| Time estimate | `note.timeEstimate` | Estimated duration |
| Recurrence | `note.recurrence` | Recurrence pattern |
| Blocked by | `note.blockedBy` | Blocking dependencies |
| Title | `file.name` | Task title (file name) |
| Created | `file.ctime` | File creation date |
| Modified | `file.mtime` | File modification date |

The exact property names depend on your TaskNotes field mapping settings (Settings → Advanced → Field Mapping). The table above shows the default mappings.

## Filtering and Sorting

### Adding Filters

Edit the `.base` file to add filter conditions using Bases query syntax:

```yaml
views:
  - type: tasknotesTaskList
    name: "High Priority Tasks"
    filters:
      and:
        - note.priority == "High"
        - note.status != "Completed"
    order:
      - note.status
      - note.priority
      - note.due
```

### Filter Operators

Bases supports standard comparison operators:
- `==` (equals), `!=` (not equals)
- `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` (comparison)
- `contains()` (substring/array membership)
- Boolean logic: `and`, `or`

For detailed filter syntax, see the [Bases documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Bases).

### Sorting Examples

Single sort criterion:
```yaml
sort:
  - column: due
    direction: ASC
```

Multiple sort criteria:
```yaml
sort:
  - column: priority
    direction: DESC
  - column: due
    direction: ASC
  - column: title
    direction: ASC
```

## Grouping

Groups organize tasks under collapsible headers based on a property value.

### Enable Grouping

Add `groupBy` configuration to your view:

```yaml
views:
  - type: tasknotesTaskList
    name: "Tasks by Status"
    groupBy:
      property: note.status
      direction: ASC
    order:
      - note.status
      - note.priority
      - note.due
```

### Available Grouping Properties

Common grouping properties:
- `note.status` - Group by task status
- `note.priority` - Group by priority level
- `note.contexts` - Group by first context
- `note.projects` - Group by project (tasks can appear in multiple groups)

### Interactive Group Headers

Group headers support interaction:
- Click to expand/collapse the group
- Click on project links in headers to navigate to project notes
- Hover over project links with Ctrl to preview project notes

### Collapsed State Persistence

Collapsed/expanded state for each group is preserved across sessions.

## Creating Multiple Views

You can create multiple `.base` files for different task perspectives:

1. Duplicate an existing `.base` file in `TaskNotes/Views/`
2. Rename it (e.g., `High Priority.base`)
3. Edit the YAML configuration for that view
4. Open the file to see the customized view

### Example: Context-Specific View

```yaml
# Work Tasks

views:
  - type: tasknotesTaskList
    name: "Work Context"
    filters:
      and:
        - note.contexts.contains("work")
    groupBy:
      property: note.priority
      direction: DESC
    order:
      - note.status
      - note.priority
      - note.due
```

## Migrating from v3 Saved Views

TaskNotes v3 stored filter configurations in plugin settings. These saved views are **not automatically migrated** to v4.

To recreate a v3 saved view:
1. Create a new `.base` file in `TaskNotes/Views/`
2. Translate your v3 filter conditions to Bases YAML syntax
3. Configure sorting and grouping through YAML
4. Save the file

The v3 FilterBar UI component no longer exists - all configuration is done through YAML editing.

## Task Actions

The Task List View provides interaction with tasks through clicking and context menus:

- **Click on a task**: Opens the task for editing or navigates to the task note (behavior configured in Settings → General → Click Actions)
- **Right-click on a task**: Opens a context menu with actions:
  - Mark as complete
  - Change priority
  - Change status
  - Edit dates
  - Delete task
  - And more

Context menu availability depends on your TaskNotes settings and task properties.

## Virtual Scrolling

The Task List View automatically enables virtual scrolling when displaying 100 or more items (tasks + group headers). Virtual scrolling provides:

- Approximately 90% memory reduction for large lists
- Elimination of UI lag when scrolling through hundreds of tasks
- Smooth performance with unlimited task counts

Virtual scrolling activates automatically and requires no configuration. When active, only visible tasks are rendered to the DOM, with off-screen tasks rendered on-demand as you scroll.
