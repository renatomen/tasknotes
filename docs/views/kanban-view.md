# Kanban View

[← Back to Views](../views.md)

The Kanban View displays tasks as cards organized in columns, where each column represents a distinct value of a grouped property. This view operates within Obsidian's Bases core plugin.

## Bases Architecture

The Kanban view functions as a Bases view type. It reads data from `.base` files located in your vault's `TaskNotes/Views/` directory. These files contain YAML frontmatter that defines the view configuration, including data source, filtering, sorting, and Kanban-specific options.

### Requirements

- Obsidian 1.10.1 or later
- Bases core plugin enabled
- A `groupBy` property configured in the view settings

The `groupBy` property determines the column structure. Each unique value of this property becomes a column in the Kanban board.

## Configuration

Kanban views are configured through the Bases interface. Open a `.base` file and access the view settings panel to configure options.

### Core Settings (Bases)

- **Data source**: Select which files or folders to include in the view
- **Filter**: Define criteria to include or exclude specific tasks
- **Sort**: Specify the order of tasks within each column
- **Group by**: Required. Defines the property that creates columns (e.g., status, priority)

### Kanban-Specific Options

Access these options through the Bases view settings panel:

- **Swim Lane**: Optional property for horizontal grouping. Creates a two-dimensional layout where tasks are organized by both column (groupBy) and row (swimLane)
- **Column Width**: Controls the width of columns in pixels. Range: 200-500px. Default: 280px
- **Hide Empty Columns**: When enabled, columns containing no tasks are hidden from the view
- **Column Order**: Managed automatically when dragging column headers. Stores custom column ordering

## Interface Layout

### Standard Layout

In standard mode, the Kanban board displays a horizontal row of columns. Each column corresponds to a unique value of the `groupBy` property.

Each column includes:
- A header showing the property value and task count
- A scrollable area containing task cards
- Drag-and-drop functionality for reordering columns or moving tasks between columns

### Swimlane Layout

When a `swimLane` property is configured, the board displays a grid layout. The horizontal axis represents columns (groupBy values), and the vertical axis represents swimlanes.

Each swimlane row includes:
- A label cell showing the swimlane property value and total task count
- Multiple cells, each representing a column within that swimlane
- Scrollable cells containing task cards

## Task Cards

Each task card displays information based on the visible properties configured in the Bases view. Standard task information includes title, priority, due date, and scheduled date.

Click a card to open the task file for editing. Right-click to access the context menu for task actions. Drag cards between columns or swimlane cells to update the task's properties.

## Column Operations

### Reordering Columns

Drag column headers to reorder columns. The new order persists across sessions and is stored in the `columnOrder` configuration.

### Drag-and-Drop Tasks

Drag task cards between columns to update the `groupBy` property value. In swimlane mode, dragging a task to a different cell updates both the `groupBy` and `swimLane` properties.

## Performance Optimization

The Kanban view implements virtual scrolling for columns or swimlane cells containing 30 or more tasks. This optimization reduces memory usage by approximately 85% and maintains 60fps scrolling performance for columns with 200+ tasks.

Virtual scrolling activates automatically based on task count. No configuration is required.

## Example Configuration

A typical Kanban view `.base` file includes:

```yaml
---
type: query
source: TaskNotes
view: TaskNotes Kanban
views:
  - name: TaskNotes Kanban
    type: tasknotesKanban
    groupBy:
      property: task.status
    config:
      swimLane: task.priority
      columnWidth: 300
      hideEmptyColumns: true
---
```

This configuration creates a Kanban board with:
- Columns based on task status
- Swimlanes based on task priority
- 300px column width
- Empty columns hidden

## Filtering and Sorting

Filtering and sorting are configured through the Bases view settings, not through a separate FilterBar component. Use the Bases filter editor to define conditions based on task properties. Use the Bases sort editor to specify the order of tasks within each column.
