# Features

TaskNotes covers the full spectrum of task management, from basic organization to advanced workflows with time tracking and calendar integration.

## Task Management

Tasks support configurable status and priority levels, along with due dates, scheduled dates, contexts, and tags. Time estimates and recurring patterns help with planning, while automatic creation and modification timestamps keep everything tracked.

Custom reminders use either relative timing ("3 days before due") or absolute dates. Tasks can auto-archive based on their completion status, keeping your active lists clean.

See [Task Management](features/task-management.md) for details.

## Filtering and Views

The FilterBar appears across multiple views, offering instant text search plus a hierarchical query builder for complex conditions using AND/OR logic. Saved views let you store frequently-used filter combinations, while sorting and grouping options organize tasks by tags, custom fields, or other properties.

See [Filtering and Views](features/filtering-and-views.md) for details.

## Inline Task Integration

Task management happens directly within your notes through interactive widgets that overlay task links, showing information and allowing quick edits without leaving the editor. Convert existing checkbox tasks instantly, or create new tasks with the `create inline task` command.

Project notes can display collapsible widgets showing all linked subtasks. Natural language processing turns conversational text into structured tasks, automatically parsing dates, priorities, and other details across 12 languages.

See [Inline Task Integration](features/inline-tasks.md) for details.

## Time Management

Built-in time tracking records work sessions for individual tasks, while the integrated Pomodoro timer helps maintain focus during work periods. Analytics and statistics show patterns in your productivity over time. A dedicated Time Statistics view allows for aggregating task time estimates over various periods.

See [Time Management](features/time-management.md) for details.

## Calendar Integration

External ICS feeds from Google Calendar, Outlook, and similar services sync into TaskNotes, while ICS export lets other systems access your task data with automatic updates.

The advanced calendar view supports multiple formats (month, week, day, year, plus configurable custom day ranges) with drag-and-drop task scheduling. Time-blocking creates focused work periods that link directly to specific tasks.

See [Calendar Integration](features/calendar-integration.md) for details.

## User Fields

Custom fields extend task structure with any data you need. These fields work in filtering, sorting, and templates, letting you adapt TaskNotes to specialized workflows without losing functionality.

See [User Fields](features/user-fields.md) for details.

## Integrations

Deep integration with the Bases plugin lets TaskNotes tasks function as data sources within Bases databases, combining structured task management with Bases' analysis capabilities.

See [Integrations](features/integrations.md) for details.

## REST API

External applications can interact with TaskNotes through its REST API, enabling automation, reporting, and integration with other tools in your workflow.

See [HTTP API](HTTP_API.md) for details.

Different views suit different work styles:

[Task List View](views/task-list.md) handles filtering, sorting, and grouping. [Agenda View](views/agenda-view.md) focuses on daily and weekly planning. [Kanban View](views/kanban-view.md) organizes tasks as cards across status columns.
